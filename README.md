# This application was to meet the following user stories:
## Customer
* As a customer, when I arrive to the home page, I see a list of all of the books, a search bar on top,  and a checkout/cart area to the right.
* As a customer, I am able to filter the list of books by title or author.
* As a customer, I am able to add a book to the cart by clicking the "Add to cart"/"book" button.
* As a customer, when I add a book to the cart, I should see the total dollar amount be updated to reflect all of the books in the cart
